# Guessing Game

Welcome to the Guessing Game! This is a simple Rust application where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.

## Overview

The Guessing Game is designed to be a fun and interactive way to practice your Rust programming skills. The game will prompt you to guess a number, and it will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number, and you can choose to play again after each round.

## Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 10.
- User input handling for guesses.
- Feedback on guesses (too high, too low, or correct).
- Limited number of attempts (5 attempts).
- Option to play again after finishing a game.

## Getting Started

To run the Guessing Game, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. You can download it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd guessing_game
   ```

4. Run the game using Cargo:

   ```
   cargo run
   ```

## How to Play

1. When prompted, enter your guess (a number between 1 and 10).
2. If you want to exit the game at any time, type `exit()`.
3. After each guess, you will receive feedback on whether your guess was correct or not.
4. If you use all your attempts without guessing correctly, the game will reveal the correct number.
5. At the end of the game, you will have the option to play again.
